# GOPractice Repository

## Description

This repository stores code written while studying the book 
"Mastering Go: Create Golang production applications using network libraries, concurrency, machine learning, and advanced data structures, 2nd Edition"
by Mihalis Tsoukalos. For myself, I keep the code here based on some examples from the book.
